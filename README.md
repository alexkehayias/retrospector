# Retrospector

An experimental star viewer that allows you to step through the galactic starfield in a hyper abstract view. Information about stars is aggregated and encoded into the placement and color of the grid. Moving in 3 dimensions and viewing in 2 dimensions allows you to maintain an objective macro view so you can take the all that pixel glory in!
